# Obsidian GitHub Issue Augmentation Plugin

A plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) that augments GitHub issue IDs with their title.

For instance, the markdown text

```
- Finished #5432
- Working on #5433
- Next: #5434, #5435
```

renders to:

Each issue title is a link to the GitHub repository.
